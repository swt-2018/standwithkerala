    <h2>2. Donate Through E-Commerce Portals</h2>

    <h3>Flipkart</h3>
    <p>
        Flipkart has tied up with NGO Goonj in order to facilitate people that want to donate to Kerala flood victims.
    <a href="https://stories.flipkart.com/flipkart-cares-kerala-flood-relief/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social" target="_blank">Donations are made in money</a>, which the NGO will then be using to procure things like blankets, tarpaulins,
    mosquito nets, dry rations, toiletries, cooking utensils, and more. To donate, simply open the Flipkart 
    app on your phone and click the banner ad for Kerala donations. You will be taken to a page where you can
    make a donation to Goonj. As a bonus, all donations made here receive a 50 percent tax exemption,
    certificate for which you’ll receive within a few weeks.<br />

    </a>

    <h3>Amazon India</h3>
    <p>
        Amazon has also tied with Goonj, as well as two other charities; Habitat for Humanity India and World Vision India. Clicking on the donation banner here will take you to a 
        <a href="https://www.amazon.in/b?ie=UTF8&node=8891257031&pf_rd_p=2c1c1ac8-3c7f-4880-b5a7-e870ec58eefa&pf_rd_r=PVTADFHY8J0JPM9NJ54F" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">description page</a>, as well as links to browse the donation wish
        lists of all three NGOs. Each of them include things like toiletries, clothes, and cooking utensils, among others. You can pick any items you wish to donate, and then select one of the registry delivery addresses before paying.
    </p>

    <h3>PayTm</h3>
    <p>
        Paytm, meanwhile, has partnered with the Kerala Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund, allowing you to donate money to flood victims.
        Simply <a href="https://blog.paytm.com/kerala-needs-our-help-70b34546c0be" target="_blank">tap the Kerala Floods icon </a>either the app or on the desktop website, and you’ll be redirected to a page which shows 'Kerala CM's Distress Relief Fund',
        you can add your name to this or let it go anonymous (up to you) and choose the amount of money that you want to donate. Unfortunately, Paytm says it won’t be able to provide tax exemption receipts, but they are promising to match every donation “Rupee for Rupee” up to Rs 1 crore
        Launch your PayTm app, below with mobile, Electricity and Fees payment shortcuts, you will now see the first one as Kerala Floods.
    </p>

    <h3>Big Basket</h3>
    <p>
        Finally, Goonj is also affiliated with Big Basket, allowing you to specifically 
        <a href="https://www.bigbasket.com/bb/csr/21/kerala-flood-relief/?nc=banner&t_pg=Home-Page-T1-T2-Aug&t_p=6th_Aug_2018&t_s=banner&t_pos_sec=1&t_pos=1&t_ch=desktop" target="_blank">donate food to flood victims</a> in need.
        Simply click on the banner on the website, and it’ll lead you to a separate shopping page. Here you can pick a bundle of dry rations to have delivered. Right now, only one bundle containing rice, sugar, and dal is available, but hopefully the selection option means more will come soon.
    </p>

    <h3>Google</h3>
    <p>
        Aside from that, if you’re safe in Kerala and want to donate to others in need, Google has a <a href="https://keralarescue.in/district_needs/" target="_blank">list of District Needs</a>
        on its Person Finder site. There’s a listing for a center in each district, with a contact person and what people in the shelters there need most. Just don’t put yourself in danger getting the things out there.
    </p>

    <h3>Truecaller</h3>
    <p>Truecaller is also allowing users to send in donation with a quick UPI or netbanking transfer to the CM Relief Fund.</p>

    <p>
        Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) with the IT mission has launched KeralaRescue.in, a website to reach out to the victims with help in kind.
    Basically, it is a communication platform between victims, volunteers and contributors, and administration. We have the admin system. There are project managers in every district working with their teams on the requests that come on the site. We have student volunteers of IEEE. Anyone can join as a volunteer. The admins have put up the requirements. People – the victims – could also add their requirements. Information will be given by admins to volunteers, who go and collect the materials from contributors and give to a common collection centre.
    </p>
    <h3>You can also request for help or register as a volunteer if you're in Kerala.</h3>
